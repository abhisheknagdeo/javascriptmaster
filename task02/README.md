## JavaScript skills need compliment from jQuery

jQuery has become the de-facto standard for utility methods and DOM selection and manipulation requirements.  We all must know jQuery thoroughly

1. Go through the example files wwhich have exercises fr jQuery 
2. We will need a dynamic TOC to be added to the file jQuery.htm which we did in the earlier session.  Do the same for this file but this time in a table.
3. Attach events to the table rows so those rows get highlighted when mouse is hovered over them.
4. Commit the modified jQuery.htm file with any other additional files you may have created in your repository.  

The features of jQuery needed to complete this exercise can be found in the exercise files in this folder.
